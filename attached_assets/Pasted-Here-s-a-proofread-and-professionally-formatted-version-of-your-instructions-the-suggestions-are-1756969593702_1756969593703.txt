Here’s a **proofread and professionally formatted version** of your instructions—the suggestions are grouped for clarity and actionability:

***

**Chimera Trading Terminal: Requested Changes**

1. **Bots Section**
   - Display all bots and show their current status alongside their names.

2. **Strategies & Diversification**
   - Allow users to choose between broad strategy types (e.g., equities and crypto).
   - Within each type, provide an option to select specific assets for strategies.
   - Design the backend for **easy addition of new strategies**:
     - The backend should automatically detect new strategy files.
     - When a new strategy is added, all required parameters should be dynamically fetched and presented in the terminal.
     - Enable users to tweak parameters directly from the terminal.
     - Structure the system modularly to simplify strategy integration.

3. **Backtesting**
   - **Fix the backtesting page**: address the crash preventing it from opening and ensure stable functionality.

4. **Dashboard/Terminal Restrictions**
   - Remove the ability to place orders from the terminal/dashboard.
   - Remove the display and handling of order books in the terminal/dashboard.

5. **Currency Converter**
   - Implement and ensure the currency converter works reliably.

6. **Performance Tab**
   - Add an option to view **daily performance** in addition to existing analytics.

7. **API Keys & Settings**
   - Centralize all API key management in the terminal’s settings section.
   - Ensure every API key (currently 3–4; add all) can be edited/updated only within this settings menu.

8. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Remove the stock chart from the dashboard for a cleaner interface.

9. **Live Time Display**
   - Make the time display on the dashboard **live** and updating in real time.

10. **Strategy Parameters Editor**
    - Fix the "Update" button: clicking it should actually update the strategy parameters.

***

**General Goals:**
- **Stability:** Eliminate crashes, especially around the backtesting page.
- **Modularity & Flexibility:** Backend must be modular for adding new strategies and managing parameters without code changes or redeployments.
- **Usability:** Streamline the user experience by minimizing manual navigation (centralized settings, dynamic parameter editing).
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Remove elements that cause clutter or are unused (orders, order books, stock chart) and focus the interface on actionable data and controls.
- **Reliability:** Ensure that all interactive UI buttons (like the "Update" button in strategy parameters and the live time display) function as intended.
