After analyzing the Chimera Trading Terminal project and incorporating the new prototype/testing requirements, here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of what‚Äôs needed for production deployment:

---

## üö® Critical Missing Components

### 1. Database Infrastructure

* **Missing:** Complete database setup and schema.
* **Issue:** Only Prisma schema exists; no actual database connection or migration files.
* **Need:** PostgreSQL setup, proper connection strings, and database migrations.
* **Update:** Ensure the system maintains a persistent connection to PostgreSQL even after restarts, remembering past logs and state.

### 2. Environment Configuration

* **Missing:** Production environment variables and secrets management.
* **Issue:** No `.env` files; API keys are hardcoded or missing.
* **Need:** Proper secrets management for broker APIs, database URLs, etc.
* **Update:** Clarify API needs ‚Äî only retain essential APIs (e.g., account management, portfolio tracker). Remove unnecessary ones.

---

## üîß Infrastructure Requirements

### 3. Execution Modes

* **Update:** Introduce three execution modes:

  1. **Testing Mode:** Uses simulated/system-generated data for interface testing.
  2. **Paper Trading Mode:** Uses real-time data feeds from APIs but executes simulated trades.
  3. **Live Trading Mode:** Uses APIs for both data feeds and real execution.

### 4. Package Management

* **Missing:** Backend dependencies in individual microservices.
* **Issue:** Only frontend packages in root `package.json`.
* **Need:** Each microservice needs its own `package.json` with proper dependencies.

### 5. Build System for Microservices

* **Missing:** Build configurations for TypeScript compilation.
* **Issue:** No `tsconfig.json` for backend services.
* **Need:** Proper build system for each microservice.

### 6. Inter-Service Communication

* **Missing:** Message queue implementation (RabbitMQ integration).
* **Issue:** Services cannot communicate with each other.
* **Need:** Proper message broker setup and event handling.

## üîê Security & Authentication

### 7. Authentication System

* **Missing:** Complete user authentication and authorization.
* **Issue:** Basic session management mentioned but not implemented.
* **Need:** JWT tokens, user management, and role-based access control.

### 8. API Security

* **Missing:** Rate limiting, CORS configuration, input validation.
* **Issue:** No security middleware implemented.
* **Need:** Comprehensive security layer.

### 9. Secrets Management

* **Missing:** Secure storage of API keys and sensitive data.
* **Issue:** Broker credentials not properly managed.
* **Need:** Environment-based secret management.

---

## üìä Data & Persistence

### 10. Database Connection Pool

* **Missing:** Production-ready database configuration.
* **Issue:** No connection pooling or optimization.
* **Need:** Proper database connection management.

### 11. Data Validation

* **Missing:** Input validation using Zod schemas.
* **Issue:** Zod schemas exist but are unused.
* **Need:** Implement validation across all endpoints.

### 12. Cache Layer

* **Missing:** Redis implementation for real-time data.
* **Issue:** No caching strategy for market data.
* **Need:** Redis setup and caching logic.

### 13. Multi-Timeframe Data Handling

* **Update:** Ensure the system collects minute, hourly, and daily candles simultaneously for strategies that require multi-timeframe confirmation. Provide caching and resampling logic to maintain efficiency.

---

## üìà Trading Core

### 14. Order Management System

* **Missing:** Complete order lifecycle management.
* **Issue:** Order interfaces exist but no implementation.
* **Need:** Full order processing, validation, and tracking.

### 15. Risk Management

* **Missing:** Real-time risk calculations and circuit breakers.
* **Issue:** Risk manager service is empty.
* **Need:** Position sizing, stop-loss, and risk monitoring.
* **Update:** Make risk handling configurable per strategy while enforcing global limits.

### 16. Strategy Engine

* **Missing:** Dynamic strategy loading and execution.
* **Issue:** Strategies exist but no execution framework.
* **Need:** Strategy orchestration and management.
* **Update:** Standardize strategies so they only generate buy/sell signals. The engine handles risk, sizing, and execution unless explicitly overridden by a strategy.

---

## üß™ Testing & Monitoring

### 17. Testing Suite

* **Missing:** Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests.
* **Issue:** No testing framework or test files.
* **Need:** Comprehensive testing strategy.
* **Update:** Add a dedicated **Testing Mode** for validating the interface, error handling, and workflows using fake/simulated data.

### 18. Logging System

* **Missing:** Structured logging and log aggregation.
* **Issue:** Basic console logging only.
* **Need:** Production logging with levels and persistence.

### 19. Monitoring & Alerting

* **Missing:** Health checks, metrics collection, alerting.
* **Issue:** Prometheus mentioned but not implemented.
* **Need:** Complete monitoring infrastructure.
* **Update:** Add robust error handling that triggers notifications with error messages.

## üöÄ Deployment & DevOps

### 20. Production Build Process

* **Missing:** Production build scripts and optimization.
* **Issue:** Only development setup exists.
* **Need:** Production-ready build pipeline.

### 21. Process Management

* **Missing:** Service orchestration and process management.
* **Issue:** No way to manage multiple microservices.
* **Need:** Process manager or container orchestration.

### 22. Error Handling

* **Missing:** Global error handling and recovery mechanisms.
* **Issue:** No centralized error management.
* **Need:** Comprehensive error handling strategy.
* **Update:** Errors must also be surfaced in user notifications.

## üîß Minor but Important Issues

### 23. Code Quality

* **Missing:** ESLint, Prettier, and code quality tools.
* **Issue:** Inconsistent code formatting and no linting.
* **Need:** Code quality enforcement.

### 24. Documentation

* **Missing:** API documentation, deployment guides.
* **Issue:** Only basic README exists.
* **Need:** Comprehensive documentation.
* **Update:** Add a **Setup Tutorial page in Settings** with detailed local deployment steps, covering database, APIs, secrets, and environment setup (even small but critical tasks).

### 25. Backup & Recovery

* **Missing:** Database backup strategies.
* **Issue:** Backup script exists but incomplete.
* **Need:** Automated backup and recovery procedures.

### 26. Performance Optimization

* **Missing:** Database indexing, query optimization.
* **Issue:** No performance considerations.
* **Need:** Performance tuning and optimization.
